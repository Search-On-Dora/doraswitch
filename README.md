# Doraswitch

A simple Chrome extension to replace commonly referenced block explorers with [Dora](https://www.ondora.xyz/). Clicking the extension icon in your menu bar will toggle it on/off if you need to visit the original page.

Currently supports:
- Ethereum (Etherscan)
- Gnosis (Gnosisscan)
- Base Testnet (Basescan)
- Scroll (Scrollscan)

Feel free to open a PR to add (or an issue to request) support for additional chains or block explorers!

To install, you'll need to know how to load an unpacked extension - it sounds intimidating but is quite simple!

Instructions can be found [here](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/).
